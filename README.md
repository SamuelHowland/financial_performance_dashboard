Financial Performance Power BI Project

Project Description

This project analyses company sales and profit data from 2014 to find which countries and products performed best. It also reviews how sales changed across the year and how product discounts impact profitability.

Business Task / Objective

1.	Identify the countries and products that made the most profit in 2014.
2.	Examine how sales and profit changed through the year.
3.	Understand if discounts supported or weakened profit margins.

Dataset

The analysis uses Microsoft’s Financial Sample.xlsx — a demo dataset that includes information on dates, countries, products, segments, sales, discounts, and profit.

Tools Used

⦁	Power BI — used for cleaning, modelling, creating DAX measures, and building the dashboard.

Process Summary

⦁	Imported the Financial Sample.xlsx file into Power BI.

⦁	In Power Query, corrected data types, removed columns that repeated date information, filtered for 2014, and renamed “United States” to “USA” for clearer visuals.

⦁	Built measures for Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin (%), Average Discount (%), and basic time calculations.

⦁	Designed a one-page dashboard with KPI cards, bar and line charts, and a scatter plot showing how discounts relate to profit margins.

Key Insights

1.	France and Canada produced the highest total profit.
2.	Sales peaked in September and November.
3.	Sales and profit followed a steady upward pattern through 2014.
4.	An average discount rate of about 7% had little overall effect on profitability.

Limitations

⦁	The dataset ends before December 2014.
⦁	No earlier years are available, so year-on-year comparisons can’t be made.

How to View

The project files are available in the GitHub folder financial_performance_dashboard, which includes the Power BI file and a dashboard image.
